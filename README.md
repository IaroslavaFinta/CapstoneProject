E-Commerce store

I built an e-commerce website where customers can browse products, register, buy products, and track their orders. This platform was developed using HTML, CSS, React, PostgreSQL, Postman, and Node.js, ensuring a seamless and dynamic user experience.

Front-End Development
The front-end of my e-commerce website was crafted to be intuitive and responsive, providing users with an engaging shopping experience. The technologies I used include HTML, CSS, and React.

Back-End Development
The back-end of my website handles data management, business logic, and server responses. I utilized Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Postman for these purposes.

Functional Overview
1. Browsing Products
Customers can easily browse through various products. I implemented API calls in the front-end to fetch product data from the back-end and display it dynamically using React components.

2. User Registration/Login
I created registration and login forms to collect user details. This information is securely sent to the back-end, where it is stored in the PostgreSQL database. Login functionality verifies user credentials against stored data.

3. Shopping Cart
Users can add products to their shopping carts. I managed the cart state using React, and the details are also sent to the back-end for persistence.

4. Placing Orders
During checkout, the front-end sends order details to the back-end, which processes the order, updates inventory, and stores the order details in the database.

5. Order Tracking
Users can track their orders through the front-end, which retrieves order status updates from the back-end.

Integration Workflow
Frontend Development:

Designed the layout using HTML and CSS.
Developed dynamic components and managed state using React.
Integrated with the back-end API to fetch and display data.

Backend Development:

Set up the Node.js server and defined API endpoints.
Created a PostgreSQL database and designed the schema.
Implemented authentication and authorization.
Developed business logic for managing products, users, and orders.

API Testing:

Used Postman to test each API endpoint.
Ensured smooth data flow between the front-end and back-end.
Debugged and resolved any issues.

By integrating these technologies and workflows, I built a fully functional e-commerce website that offers a seamless user experience and efficient back-end operations.
